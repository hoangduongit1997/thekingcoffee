# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/
   - assets/i18n/
   - assets/icons/
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: BalooBhai-Regular
     fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/BalooBhai-Regular.ttf
   - family: SFUIText-Medium
     fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/SFUIText-Medium.ttf
   - family: SFUIText-Regular
     fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/SFUIText-Regular.ttf
   - family: VarelaRound-Regular
     fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/VarelaRound-Regular.ttf
   - family: Raleway-Bold
     fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Bold.ttf
   - family: Raleway-Regular
     fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
   - family: RobotoMono-Bold
     fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoMono-Bold.ttf
   - family: RobotoMono-Regular
     fonts:
